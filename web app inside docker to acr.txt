1. web app -> docker image -> private image 
2. docker image -> container registry (azure)
3. once we upload we can create image, this can be pulled once we create azure web app


azure > container registry -> create a new one
> subs , RG, Registry name, location
> review and create
> go to resource
> access key - admin user enable, copy the login server and keep it handy
, password, password2

> go to overview

Home > create resource > web app - sub, rg, name, publish - docker container
os - linux, region,   docker - option - single container, image source ACR, Registry, image - empty (we have to build it from our specific repo)

we need to have docker desktop

docker build -t urlofcontainerregistry.azurecr.io(we had saved it)/ourapplicationname:latest . <it will take some time>

docker login urlofcontainerregistry(we had saved it).azurecr.io, it will ask for username and password

docker push urlofcontainerregistry.azurecr.io(we had saved it)/ourapplicationname:latest  <the entire docker image is pushed to container registry>  it will take some min


We can see our image file in the acr

Create the web app
-------------------
subs, rg, name, publish -docker container
docker - single container, image cource acr, registry name, automatically image will be shown
create and validate
create
now when we go to the RG, we can see the web app
when the app is created, go to resource
go to deployment center -> we will get many option
keep continuous deployment to on
source - github action
organization, repo, branch
registry setting - registry source, subscription id, authentication - admin credentials, registry, image  -> save (saving container configuration)

in the github we will see .github/ workflows getting showed and github action is running

we will see the entire build and deployment pipeline is executed(we will get email too)


Build ->
1. setup job
2. run actions/checkout@v2
3. set up docker buildx
4. login to registry
5. build and push container image to registry
6. post build and push continaer image to registry
7. post login to registry
8. post set up docker buildx
9. post run actions/checkout@v2


deploy ->
1. setup job
2. deploy to azure web app
3. complete job (we will get the url) 2 min to load
