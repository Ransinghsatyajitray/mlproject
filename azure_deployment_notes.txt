1. signing to azure
2. create resourese
3. create webapp > subs / RG/ Web app name (app will be named webappnamewe havegiven.azurewebsites.net
4. publish - code
5.runtime - python 3.8
6. next
7. deployment - Github action settings - enable, github account , organization (usually github name), repo, branch main
8. review create
9. create (it takes couple of min)
10. automatically a .github/workflow folder will get created in github once the deployment is complete
11. if we see the file inside .github/workflow main_webappnamewehavegiven.yml file is created. 
It say name -> description
push -> the branch we are pushing from / where the code needs to be dispatched

job -> build -----
build -> run-on - ubuntu-latest server
steps -> it pushes the repo
python version -> 
run -> the virtual environment creation and activation (name <description>and run<terminal command>)
run -> installing dependencies
run -> uploading the artifact for deployment jobs, where the artifacts are going


job -> deploy -----
run-on - ubuntu-latest server
environemnt -> web app url we specified in azure, it is picking from secret key
steps to deploy

publish profile



in Github if we go to setting 
secrets and variables > actions > we see a secret variable has been created in github (this secret key accesses all the secrets mentioned in the yml file)

The github action actually creates the entire yml file. 

As soon as the yml file is created , we can see in github > actions all the build and deploy steps

build ---
1. set up job
2. run actions/checkout@v2 - it is syncing with which repo, it is seeing the app runner (it facilitate the automatically build is happending when the changes are happening), it is fetching the repo 
3. set up python version - 
4. create and start virtual environement
5. Install dependencies
6. upload artifacts for deployment jobs
7. post run actions/checkout@v2 (what ever cleanup is required after github repo is synced with the cloud)
8. complete job


the entire steps mentioned on the build is happening line by line


deployment ---
